# Qiskit Learning Guide

This is a beginner-friendly documentation and explanation guide for Qiskit, IBM's open-source quantum computing framework.  
We'll start with the basic concepts of quantum circuits, explain how Qiskit represents quantum and classical bits, and show you how to install Qiskit and start coding!

# Topics Covered
- What is a quantum circuit?
- Representing qubits and classical bits
- Basic quantum operations (gates)
- Installing Qiskit (with pip and Anaconda)
- Running your first quantum program

> ðŸ”¬ This guide assumes no prior experience in quantum computing or Qiskit.
# Quantum-Circuits-with-Qiskit
Qiskit is a powerful toolkit that allows you to design, simulate, and run quantum circuits on both simulators and real quantum computers provided by IBM Quantum.

Quantum circuits are the heart of quantum computing. In classical computing, we work with bits (0 or 1), but in quantum computing, we work with qubits, which can exist in superpositions of states. Qiskit makes it easy to build quantum circuits using basic quantum gates, visualize them, and understand how quantum algorithms work in practice.
