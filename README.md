# Qiskit Learning Guide

This is a beginner-friendly documentation and explanation guide for Qiskit, IBM's open-source quantum computing framework.  
We'll start with the basic concepts of quantum circuits, explain how Qiskit represents quantum and classical bits, and show you how to install Qiskit and start coding!

# Topics Covered
- What is a quantum circuit?
- Representing qubits and classical bits
- Basic quantum operations (gates)
- Installing Qiskit (with pip and Anaconda)
- Running your first quantum program

> ğŸ”¬ This guide assumes no prior experience in quantum computing or Qiskit.
