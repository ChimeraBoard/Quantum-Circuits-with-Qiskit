#  Introduction to Quantum Circuits

Quantum circuits are the core framework for programming quantum computers.

- A **quantum circuit** consists of qubits (quantum bits), operations (quantum gates), and measurements.
- A **qubit** can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1 states.
- Quantum gates manipulate the state of qubits, just like logic gates operate on classical bits.

> ðŸ’¡ Visualization: Each qubit is represented as a horizontal wire, while a double wire carry a single classical bit. Operations (gates) are applied along these wires, and measurements are shown at the end.
